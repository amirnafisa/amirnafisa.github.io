##Decon

[Github Link](https://github.com/amirnafisa/Decon)

August 2019 - May 2020

<img src="./images/decon.png" alt="decon" width="300"/>

It is an APL sponsored project to tackle healthcare associated infections. This projects
aims to provide an autonomous solution for disinfecting healthcare facilities in human and non-human 
presence. 

Highlighting sections of the project include:

- Autonomous navigation
- 3D Slam creation
- Depth estimation using LiDAR and stereo camera
- Faster R-CNN based object detection including the type of object and its location
- A robotic ARM that based on the detected location orients itself
- Disinfecting cone attached to the arm
- Dual mode disinfection including both UV light at 280nm wavelength and disinfecting spray
- Battery operated systems
- Safety mechanism


##Time Travel

[Github Link](https://github.com/amirnafisa/time-travel-for-oose)

August 2019 - Dec 2019

<img src="./images/timetravel.png" alt="timetravel" width="300"/>

It is a web application based on client-server architecture for 
organizing travel itineraries and detecting discrepancies in travel plans.

To make travelling convenient and less cumbersome, it offers following highlighting
features:

- Extracts travel bookings from email without manual intervention
- Keeps all bookings in one place
- Arranges in chronological order
- The bookings highlight specific details, like flight number, check-in time, location etc.
- Detects if there is a reservation missing
- Detects if there is an overlap in reservations
- Detects any discrepancy in reservations (Incorrect month or date or missing transportation)
- A visual preview in a map of the travel
- Allows manual addition/deletion of a booking


##Legal IR

[Github Link](https://github.com/amirnafisa/InformationRetrieval)

January 2019 - May 2019

<img src="./images/legalIR.png" alt="legalIR" width="300"/>

This project aims to use and compare various architectures for catchphrase extraction
from legal documents. Legal documents provide a large text base with technical vocabulary
specific to the legal domain. This is taken to the advantage of comparing vector based models, 
conditional random fields based models, recurrent neural network based models and long short 
term memory networks.

August 2018 - December 2018

<img src="./images/foodNN.png" alt="foodNN" width="300"/>

Food NN is a neural network based project for food image classification. 
It aims to fine tune and ensemble deep neural network architectures in 
resource constrained environment.

Resnet-152 and Inception-v3 are used and ensembled based on weighted average
of the probabilites obtained from the two models. The weight coefficients are 
computed through hyperparameter tuning.

Top-1 accuracy of the ensemble is 4% higher and top-5 accuracy is 3% higher than 
that of the inception model.


##Parser

[Python Implementation](https://github.com/amirnafisa/Parsing)

[C Implementation](https://github.com/amirnafisa/ParserInC)

August 2018 - December 2018

<img src="./images/parser.png" alt="parser" width="300"/>

This is a demonstration of the famous Earley's parser. 

Algorithmic complexity of the algorithm is O(R<sup>2</sup>N<sup>3</sup>), 
where R is the number of rules and N is the number of words (including 
punctuation literals as unit components). Few pruning strategies are incorporated
to speed up the parser. 

Speed up techniques used are:
- Left corner filtering
- better indexing
- filtering grammar of terminals not needed for the input
- preventing duplicate entries
- keeping only the high probability entries
- pruning rules with lower probabilities

Initial implemenation of parser in python helped in better understanding. C 
implementation was however necessary to improve the speed.
