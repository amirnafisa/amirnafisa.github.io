Food NN is a neural network based project for food image classification. 
It aims to fine tune and ensemble deep neural network architectures in 
resource constrained environment.

##Parser

[Python Implementation](https://github.com/amirnafisa/Parsing)

[C Implementation](https://github.com/amirnafisa/ParserInC)

This is a demonstration of the famous Earley's parser. 

Algorithmic complexity of the algorithm is O(R<sup>2</sup>N<sup>3</sup>), 
where R is the number of rules and N is the number of words (including 
punctuation literals as unit components). Few pruning strategies are incorporated
to speed up the parser. 

Speed up techniques used are:
- Left corner filtering
- better indexing
- filtering grammar of terminals not needed for the input
- preventing duplicate entries
- keeping only the high probability entries
- pruning rules with lower probabilities

Initial implemenation of parser in python helped in better understanding. C 
implementation was however necessary to improve the speed.
